# Personalized Learning Assistant: AI-Powered Smart Education Platform

Welcome to EduAI, a personalized learning assistant designed to revolutionize education by leveraging AI to cater to individual learning needs. Built for the "Power Hacks 2024" Hackathon, this project focuses on enhancing student engagement and knowledge retention through an interactive AI chatbot.

Features
Current (Hackathon Version):
    AI Chatbot for Learning:
        An interactive chatbot that answers student queries, explains concepts, and adapts its responses based on user inputs.
    Continuous Conversation:
        Maintains conversational context to provide more personalized responses during a session.

Future Enhancements:
    Custom Exercises:
        The chatbot will recommend exercises tailored to individual student needs.
    Student Analytics:
        Teachers can monitor student performance through detailed dashboards.
    Language Learning Tools:
        Gamified language practice, including quizzes and pronunciation feedback.
    Special Needs Support:
        Learning aids for students with special needs, such as visual content and speech-to-text features.

Tech Stack

    Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Bootstrap for styling)

How It Works
    Students interact with the chatbot by submitting queries via a user-friendly web interface.
